The R package vtrackR provides a function to generate version tracking headers and a SHA1 digest algorithm. The vtrackR package is best used by making it a default package. To do this, edit the $RHOME/etc/R/Renviron.site file and add the line:

R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES='utils,grDevices,graphics,stats,vtrackR'

Please do not copy-paste the code. Instead, use 'git clone git@github.com:gui11aume/vtrackR.git' to have the full version history.

The code is here for reproducibility and mistake-tracking purposes, but feel free to copy, reuse and modify it in any way you like.
